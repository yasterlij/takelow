# TakeLow

A mobile-first reverse-auction platform using a **Lowest Unique Bid (LUB)** mechanism.
The winner is the user who submits the lowest unique bid amount before the timer expires.

> "Take It. Low."

---

## Architecture

Three NestJS microservices + React web + React Native (Expo) mobile:

| Service | Port | Responsibility |
|---------|------|----------------|
| `identity-service` | 3001 | Better-auth authentication, user registration, wallet, PIN, OTP, notifications, RBAC, disputes, T&C |
| `auction-engine` | 3002 | Real-time bidding, WebSockets (Redis adapter), Redis bid tracking, BullMQ workers, winner determination, payments, product approval, payment reminders |
| `query-service` | 3003 | Read-optimized auction/product queries, Redis caching, favorites, admin stats, settlement reports, analytics, audit viewer, winner management |
| `takelow-web` | 5173 (dev) / 80 (docker) | React + Tailwind SPA |
| `takelow-app` | Expo | React Native mobile app |

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **ORM** | Prisma 7 (all 3 services) |
| **Auth** | Better-auth (identity-service) + JwtAuthGuard (auction-engine, query-service) |
| **RBAC** | CASL ability-based access control with enterprise role hierarchy |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 15 + Citus 12.1 (distributed) |
| **Cache** | Redis 7 (caching, rate limiting, queues, WebSocket adapter, pub/sub) |
| **Queue** | BullMQ (batched bid persistence, notification dispatch) |
| **Real-time** | Socket.io 4 with Redis adapter for horizontal scaling |
| **Framework** | NestJS 10 + TypeScript 5 (strict mode) |
| **Frontend** | React 19 + Vite 5 + Tailwind CSS 3 |
| **Mobile** | React Native 0.86 + Expo SDK 52 |
| **Deployment** | Docker Compose (dev), Kubernetes (production) |

### Data Layer

PostgreSQL 15 (Citus) + Redis 7 (bid tracking, rate limiting, queues, caching, WebSocket adapter) + BullMQ (batched bid persistence).

## Enterprise RBAC (CASL)

TakeLow implements enterprise-grade role-based access control using CASL:

```
Level 1: CEO / Admin     → Full system access (all divisions, departments, sections)
Level 2: CXO             → Division-level access (CFO, CCO, CTO)
Level 3: Director        → Department-level access
Level 4: Manager         → Section-level access
Level 5: Expert          → Functional area access
Level 6: Specialist      → Narrow module scope
Level 7: Analyst         → Read-only/reporting access
Level 7: User            → Standard user (bidding, wallet, favorites)
```

**Features:**
- CASL ability factory with granular action+subject permissions
- `@RequireAbility(action, subject)` decorator for endpoint protection
- Dynamic permission overrides (temporary elevated access with expiry)
- Access decision audit logging (every access attempt logged)
- Organizational structure (divisions → departments → sections)
- UI enforcement API (`GET /rbac/abilities` returns permissions for frontend)

## Quick Start

```bash
# One-time: install deps + start infra + migrate + seed
npm run setup

# Full stack (Docker -> backends -> web frontend)
npm run dev

# Mobile app (Expo)
npm run app

# Backends only (requires Docker for Postgres/Redis)
npm run services
```

## Common Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run docker:up` | Start Postgres + Redis containers |
| `npm run docker:down` | Stop containers |
| `npm run db:setup` | Docker -> wait -> migrate -> seed |
| `npm run db:reset` | Wipe volumes -> migrate -> seed |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Apply SQL migrations (tracked in `schema_migrations`) |
| `npm run seed` | Seed 30 users + enterprise roles + 24 products + 24 auctions |

## Seed Credentials

### Enterprise Roles

| Role | Phone | Password | Level |
|------|-------|----------|-------|
| Admin/CEO | `0911111111` | `1234` | 1 |
| CXO (CTO) | `0913320001` | `0000` | 2 |
| CXO (COO) | `0913320002` | `0000` | 2 |
| Director | `0913320003` | `0000` | 3 |
| Manager | `0913320006` | `0000` | 4 |
| Expert | `0913320010` | `0000` | 5 |
| Specialist | `0913320013` | `0000` | 6 |
| Analyst | `0913320016` | `0000` | 7 |
| User | `0913320018`–`0913320028` | `0000` | 7 |

All users have T&C accepted (v1.0), wallet PIN set (`0000` for users, `1234` for admins).

| `REDIS_SENTINEL_MASTER_NAME` | Redis Sentinel master name |
| `REDIS_CLUSTER_NODES` | Redis Cluster (sharding) — comma-separated `host:port` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | JWT signing secret (must NOT be `takelow-jwt-secret`) |
| `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` | JWT refresh token secret |
| `INTERNAL_API_KEY` | Service-to-service authentication |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated allowed origins |
| `SIKINA_*` | SikinaPay payment gateway config |
| `AWASH_*` | Awash Bank payment gateway config |
| `SMS_API_KEY` | SMS Ethiopia API key |

## Testing & Verification

```bash
# Backend tests (per service)
cd identity-service && npm test      # 8 tests
cd auction-engine && npm test        # 54 tests
cd query-service && npm test         # 3 tests

# Type checking (all 5 projects)
npx tsc --noEmit

# Prisma commands (per service)
npm run prisma:generate              # Generate Prisma client
npm run prisma:migrate               # Create and apply migration
npm run prisma:deploy                # Deploy migrations (production)
