## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document specifies the functional and non-functional requirements for **TakeLow**, a mobile-first reverse auction platform operating on the **Lowest Unique Bid (LUB)** mechanism. It serves as the authoritative reference for developers, architects, testers, and stakeholders throughout the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

This document is prepared in conformance with **IEEE Standard 830-1998** (*IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications*). The structure, language conventions, and content organization adhere to the recommended practice. Mandatory requirements use the verb **"shall"**; recommended requirements use **"should"**; optional requirements use **"may"**.

### 1.2 Scope

TakeLow enables users to participate in timed auctions by placing monetary bids. The winner is the participant who submits the **lowest unique bid amount** (up to 2 decimal places) before the auction timer expires. Winners shall pay the winning amount within a configurable deadline (default 24 hours).

The system encompasses:
- **Three microservices**: Identity Service, Auction Engine, Query Service
- **Two frontend applications**: Web (React + Vite) and Mobile (React Native / Expo)
- **PostgreSQL 15 / Citus** distributed database with **Redis 7** for caching, rate-limiting, and real-time messaging
- **Prisma ORM** for type-safe database access and migration management
- **Payment gateway integrations**: SikinaPay and Awash Bank
- **Push notification infrastructure**: Expo Push Service + SMS

---

## 12. Acceptance Criteria

> Acceptance criteria define the verifiable conditions that must be met for each requirement to be considered satisfied. Each criterion is testable and measurable.

### 12.1 Authentication & Registration

| Req ID | Acceptance Criteria |
|--------|-------------------|
| FR-AUTH-01 | Given a valid phone, email, or OAuth credential, when the user submits registration, then an account is created and a verification challenge is initiated. All five strategies are tested end-to-end. |
| FR-AUTH-02 | Given a password, when stored, then the stored value is a bcrypt hash with cost factor 12 and cannot be reversed to the plaintext. |
| FR-AUTH-03 | Given valid credentials, when the user logs in, then a JWT access token (15-min expiry) and refresh token (7-day expiry) are issued. On refresh, a new refresh token is issued and the old one is invalidated. |
| FR-AUTH-05 | Given 5 failed login attempts within 60 seconds, when a 6th attempt is made, then the request is rejected with HTTP 429. |
| FR-AUTH-09 | Given 5 failed PIN attempts, when a 6th attempt is made, then the wallet is locked for 30 minutes. |

### 12.2 Product & Auction Management

| Req ID | Acceptance Criteria |
|--------|-------------------|
| FR-PROD-01 | Given an admin with products:write permission, when CRUD operations are performed, then all operations succeed and are logged to the audit trail. |
| FR-PROD-02 | Given a new product, when created, then its status is PENDING. Given admin approval, then status transitions to APPROVED and the action is audited. Given admin rejection, then status transitions to REJECTED with reason recorded. Given a PENDING or REJECTED product, when used for auction creation, then the operation is rejected. |
| FR-AUCT-04 | Given an auction at closure with bids below minimum threshold, when closure is evaluated, then the auction end time is extended by 24 hours. |
| FR-TC-01 | Given a user who has not accepted the current T&C version, when attempting to bid, then the bid is rejected and the user is prompted to accept T&C. Given acceptance, when the user bids, then the bid is accepted and the acceptance is recorded with version, timestamp, and user ID. |

### 12.3 Bidding Engine

| Req ID | Acceptance Criteria |
|--------|-------------------|
| FR-BID-02 | Given a user with 150 bids in an auction, when a 151st bid is attempted, then the request is rejected. |
| FR-BID-04 | Given multiple bids with varying amounts, when the auction is queried for the lowest unique bid, then the correct lowest unique amount is returned via Redis ZSET computation. |
| FR-BID-07 | Given the same nonce submitted twice within 60s, when the second request is received, then it is rejected as a replay. |

### 12.4 Winner Determination & Payment

| Req ID | Acceptance Criteria |
|--------|-------------------|
| FR-WIN-01 | Given an auction with bids, when the auction closes, then the winner is correctly identified as the lowest unique bidder. |
| FR-WIN-06 | Given a winner who has not paid within 24 hours, when the deadline expires, then the winner is marked expired and the next ranked winner is notified. |
| FR-WIN-10 | Given a winner with a pending payment, when 6 hours and 1 hour remain before the deadline, then SMS and push notifications are sent and logged. |

### 12.5 Admin Operations

| Req ID | Acceptance Criteria |
|--------|-------------------|
| FR-ADM-08 | Given a settlement period, when a report is generated, then it contains total revenue, platform share, tax withheld, and commission per auction, is exportable in CSV and PDF, and the generation is logged. |
| FR-ADM-09 | Given the analytics dashboard, when accessed with a date range, then revenue, user, auction, bid, and payment analytics are displayed with correct aggregations. |
| FR-ADM-10 | Given the audit log viewer, when filters are applied (actor, action, entity, date range), then matching logs are returned with pagination, sorting, and CSV export capability. |
| FR-ADM-11 | Given the winner management dashboard, when an admin views winners by status, then winners are correctly filtered. When an admin extends a deadline or triggers rotation, then the action succeeds and is audited. |

### 12.6 Performance & Caching

| Req ID | Acceptance Criteria |
|--------|-------------------|
| FR-PERF-01 | Given a read-heavy endpoint, when requested, then the response is served from Redis cache on cache hit. When the underlying data changes, then the cache is invalidated. When the cache is unavailable, then the system falls back to the database and returns correct results. |
| NFR-PERF-01 | Given normal load conditions, when read API responses are measured at p95, then latency is ≤ 100ms. |

### 12.7 Security

| Req ID | Acceptance Criteria |
|--------|-------------------|
| NFR-SEC-03 | Given a webhook with an invalid HMAC-SHA256 signature, when received, then the request is rejected with HTTP 401 and logged. |
| NFR-SEC-08 | Given an existing audit log entry, when an UPDATE or DELETE is attempted, then the operation is rejected at the database level. |
