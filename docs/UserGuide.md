## 1. System Overview

**TakeLow** is a reverse auction platform with a simple but exciting twist: the **lowest unique bid wins**.

### How It Works

1. **Browse Auctions**: Explore products up for auction — smartphones, laptops, electronics, and more.
2. **Pay the Bid Fee**: Each bid requires a small, non-refundable service fee (starting from 1.00 ETB).
3. **Place Your Bid**: Enter your bid amount. Lower bids have a better chance of being unique.
4. **Wait for the Timer**: When the auction ends, the system finds the lowest unique bid.
5. **Win and Pay**: If you win, you have 24 hours to complete your payment and claim your item.

### Key Features
- **Lowest Unique Bid (LUB)**: Be strategic — your bid must be both low and unique.
- **Real-Time Updates**: See live bid counts and auction status via Socket.io.
- **Secure Wallet**: Deposit funds and pay with your internal wallet or via payment gateways.
- **Winner Transparency**: View full bid breakdowns after auction closure.
- **Notifications**: Get push, SMS, and in-app alerts for bids, wins, and extensions.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Full control for platform administrators.
- **Product Approval Process**: All products are vetted before being listed for auction.
- **Terms & Conditions Acceptance**: Users must accept T&C before participating.
- **Settlement Transparency**: Revenue and settlement data are published for review.

**Admin Path:** Home → Admin Dashboard → Specific Admin Module

- **Favorite**: Tap the heart icon to save to your favorites.

`[screenshot: auction-detail-annotated.png]`

### Understanding Auction Extensions

TakeLow uses fair-play rules to ensure all users have a fair chance:

1. **Minimum Bid Extension**: If an auction reaches its end time but the total number of bids is below the `min_bid` threshold, the auction is automatically extended by 24 hours. This prevents auctions from closing too early with insufficient participation.

2. **No Unique Bid Extension**: If an auction reaches its end time but all bids are duplicated (no unique bids exist), the auction is extended by 24 hours. This can happen multiple times until at least one unique bid is placed.

3. **Maximum Bid Early Close**: If an auction reaches its `max_bid` limit, it closes immediately regardless of the timer.

4. **Extension Counter**: Each auction tracks how many times it has been extended in the `extensions` field. There is no hard limit on extensions.

**What This Means for You:**
- Your bids remain valid during extensions.
- You may receive a notification if an auction you bid on is extended.
- The auction will only close when fair-play conditions are met or the maximum bid count is reached.

> **Info**: Extension rules are applied automatically and identically to all auctions. They cannot be overridden by administrators for specific users.

### 4.4 Placing a Bid

**Step 1: Pay the Bid Fee**
1. On the auction detail screen, tap **"Place Bid"**.
   - `[screenshot: place-bid-step-1.png]`

> - Maximum 150 bids per auction per user.
> - Each bid costs the configured bid fee.

   - `[screenshot: winner-screen-annotated.png]`

> **Info**: The full bid breakdown is available to all users after auction closure. This transparency allows any participant to independently verify the winning result.

### Understanding Winner Rotation

If you win an auction but do not pay within 24 hours:
1. Your payment status changes to **EXPIRED**.
2. The system automatically offers the auction to the **next winner** (the second lowest unique bid).
3. The next winner receives a notification and has 24 hours to pay.
4. This rotation continues down the list of winners until someone pays or all winners are exhausted.
5. If no winner pays, the auction is marked as **EXPIRED** with no winner.

### 4.7 Paying for a Won Auction

## 9. Fair Play Guarantee

TakeLow guarantees that all auctions are conducted fairly, transparently, and without manipulation. This section explains the technical and procedural safeguards that ensure fairness.

### 9.1 The Lowest Unique Bid (LUB) Algorithm

The winner of each auction is determined by the **Lowest Unique Bid** algorithm:

1. **Uniqueness Check**: For each bid amount, the system counts how many users placed that exact amount.
2. **Unique Bid Identification**: Amounts placed by exactly one user are identified as "unique bids."
3. **Lowest Selection**: Among all unique bids, the lowest amount is the winning bid.
4. **Winner Assignment**: The user who placed the lowest unique bid is declared the winner.

**Example:**
| Bid Amount | Number of Bidders | Unique? |
|------------|-------------------|---------|
| 1.00 | 3 | No (duplicated) |
| 2.00 | 1 | Yes |
| 3.00 | 1 | Yes |
| 5.00 | 2 | No (duplicated) |

In this example, the unique bids are 2.00 and 3.00. The **lowest unique bid is 2.00**, and the user who placed it wins.

### 9.2 Algorithm Integrity Safeguards

The LUB algorithm is protected by multiple safeguards:

1. **Atomic Processing**: Each bid is processed sequentially per auction using distributed locks. No two bids are processed simultaneously for the same auction, eliminating race conditions.
2. **Nonce Validation**: Each bid request includes a unique nonce to prevent replay attacks and duplicate submissions.
3. **Immutable Bid Records**: Once a bid is recorded, it cannot be modified or deleted by any user or administrator. Bids are stored with a cryptographic integrity check.
4. **Deterministic Calculation**: Winner selection is a pure function of the recorded bids. Given the same set of bids, the algorithm always produces the same result — there is no randomization or administrator discretion in winner selection.
5. **Real-Time Verification**: The live auction monitor continuously recalculates the lowest unique bid, allowing administrators and users to observe the current state at any time.
6. **Post-Closure Audit**: After each auction closes, the full bid breakdown is published and can be independently verified by any participant.

### 9.3 Audit Trail

Every auction generates a complete audit trail that includes:

- **Bid Log**: Every bid placed, with timestamp, amount, and ticket number.
- **Extension Log**: Every extension applied, with reason and timestamp.
- **Winner Calculation Log**: The exact inputs and output of the LUB algorithm at closure.
- **Winner Rotation Log**: If winner rotation occurs, each step with the offered winner and their response.
- **Closure Record**: Final auction state, winning bid, and settlement initiation.

> **Info**: The audit trail for each auction is available to all participants on the Winner Screen. Administrators can access the full audit trail via the Admin Audit Logs module. Audit records are immutable and retained indefinitely.

### 9.4 Fair Play Rules Summary

| Rule | Purpose | Automatic? |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Minimum Bid Extension | Ensures sufficient participation before closure | Yes |
| No Unique Bid Extension | Ensures a valid winner exists before closure | Yes |
| Maximum Bid Early Close | Prevents unbounded auction duration | Yes |
| Winner Rotation | Ensures the auction concludes with a paying winner | Yes |
| Bid Limit (150 per user) | Prevents domination by a single user | Yes |
| Sequential Processing | Prevents race conditions | Yes |

> **Note**: Fair play rules are applied uniformly to all auctions and cannot be selectively overridden. Any administrator action that affects an auction (force close, manual draw) is logged with full context in the audit trail.

---

## 10. Financial Protection

TakeLow implements multiple layers of financial protection to safeguard user funds and ensure transaction integrity.

### 10.1 Wallet Security

1. **PIN Protection**: All wallet transactions require a 4-6 digit PIN. After 5 failed attempts, the PIN is locked for 30 minutes.
2. **Encryption at Rest**: Wallet balances and transaction data are encrypted using AES-256-GCM.
3. **Transaction Authentication**: Every wallet transaction is authenticated against the user's active session and PIN.
4. **Balance Integrity**: Wallet balances are maintained as a derived value from the immutable transaction log, not as a mutable counter. This prevents balance corruption.
5. **Deposit Verification**: All deposits require confirmation from the payment gateway (via signed webhook) before the wallet balance is updated. Unsigned or tampered webhooks are rejected.
6. **Withdrawal Limits**: Wallet deposits are capped at 1,000,000 ETB per transaction. Daily aggregate limits may apply.

### 10.2 Payment Protection

1. **Gateway Integration**: Payments are processed through established gateways (Awash Bank, SikinaPay). TakeLow never stores full card numbers or banking credentials.
2. **Webhook Signature Verification**: All payment webhooks are verified using HMAC-SHA256 signatures with constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks.
3. **Idempotent Processing**: Payment callbacks are processed idempotently — duplicate webhook deliveries do not result in double crediting.
4. **Timeout Protection**: Payment links expire after 30 seconds of inactivity. Pending payments that do not receive webhook confirmation within 5 minutes are flagged for manual review.
5. **Failed Payment Safety**: If a payment fails, no funds are deducted from the user's wallet or external account. The user may retry without penalty.

### 10.3 Refund Policy

The complete refund policy is defined in [Section 6.6](#66-refund-policy). Key principles:

- Bid fees are non-refundable as they represent a service charge for participation.
- Winner payments are refundable if the auction is cancelled by the platform.
- System-error-induced duplicate payments are refunded after verification.
- All refunds are processed to the original payment method where possible.

### 10.4 Winner Payment Protection

1. **24-Hour Window**: Winners have 24 hours to complete payment, clearly communicated via notification and on-screen countdown.
2. **Winner Rotation**: If the primary winner does not pay, the auction is offered to subsequent winners — no user is forced to pay for an auction they did not actively win.
3. **Payment Confirmation**: Winner payments are confirmed via the same gateway webhook process as bid fees, ensuring the same level of verification.
4. **Delivery Tracking**: After winner payment, a delivery tracking reference is provided so the winner can monitor shipment.

### 10.5 Financial Transparency

1. **Transaction History**: Users can view their complete transaction history at any time via the Wallet module.
2. **Settlement Records**: Settlement records for each auction are maintained and available to administrators, showing revenue sources and distribution.
3. **Statement Export**: Users can export their transaction history as CSV or JSON for personal records or tax purposes.
4. **Audit Linkage**: Every financial transaction is linked to an audit log entry, enabling end-to-end traceability.

> **Info**: Payment records are retained for 7 years in accordance with financial record-keeping standards. Audit logs are retained indefinitely.

### 13.4 Payment Reminder System

TakeLow sends automated payment reminders to winners to ensure they do not miss the 24-hour payment window.

**Reminder Schedule:**

| Reminder | Timing | Channel | Content |
|----------|--------|---------|---------|
| **Initial Winner Notification** | At auction closure | Push, SMS (if enabled), In-app | "You won! Complete payment within 24 hours." |
| **First Reminder** | 6 hours after closure | Push, In-app | "18 hours remaining to complete your payment." |
| **Second Reminder** | 18 hours after closure | Push, SMS (if enabled), In-app | "6 hours remaining to complete your payment." |
| **Final Reminder** | 23 hours after closure | Push, SMS, In-app (always sent) | "1 hour remaining! Payment expires soon." |
| **Expiration Notice** | 24 hours after closure | Push, In-app | "Payment window expired. Auction offered to next winner." |

**How it works:**
1. When an auction closes and you are the winner, the reminder schedule is automatically activated.
2. Reminders are sent via your configured notification channels (see [Section 13.3](#133-sms-notification-preferences)).
3. The **Final Reminder** and **Expiration Notice** are always sent regardless of preferences, as they concern a time-sensitive financial obligation.
4. If you complete payment at any point, remaining reminders are automatically cancelled.
5. If you do not pay, the expiration notice informs you that the auction has been offered to the next winner.

> **Info**: The payment reminder system is designed to protect users from accidentally forfeiting won auctions due to missed deadlines.

### 13.5 Settlement and Revenue Transparency

TakeLow publishes settlement data for each closed auction, providing transparency into how revenue is collected and distributed.

**User View:**
1. After an auction closes, go to the **Winner Screen** for that auction.
2. Tap **"Settlement Details"**.

   - Total bids placed and total bid fee revenue collected
   - Winning bid amount and winner payment status
   - Whether the auction resulted in a completed settlement or expiration

**Admin View:**
1. Go to **Admin** → **"Settlements"** (see [Section 5.7](#57-settlements-and-revenue-transparency)).
2. View the full settlement record for any auction:

   - Winner payment amount and status
   - Platform revenue (bid fees + winner payment, minus any refunds)
   - Settlement status and date
3. Export settlement reports as CSV for accounting or audit purposes.

**Transparency Commitments:**
- Settlement records are immutable once completed.
- Every settlement is linked to its source auction and all constituent transactions.
- Settlement data is available for independent review.
- Revenue from bid fees is clearly separated from winner payments.

## 16. Device Compatibility & Network Requirements

### 16.1 Device Compatibility Matrix

#### Web Platform

| Browser | Minimum Version | Supported | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| **Google Chrome** | 90+ | ✅ | Recommended for best experience |
| **Mozilla Firefox** | 88+ | ✅ | Fully supported |
| **Apple Safari** | 14+ | ✅ | Fully supported (macOS and iOS) |
| **Microsoft Edge** | 90+ | ✅ | Fully supported (Chromium-based) |
| **Samsung Internet** | 14+ | ✅ | Supported (Android) |
| **Opera** | 76+ | ✅ | Supported (Chromium-based) |
| **Internet Explorer 11** | — | ❌ | Not supported (end of life) |

#### Mobile Platform

| OS | Minimum Version | Form Factor | Notes |
|----|-----------------|-------------|-------|
| **iOS** | 14.0+ | iPhone, iPad | Expo Go or native build |
| **Android** | 10.0 (API 29)+ | Phone, Tablet | Expo Go or native build |
| **iPadOS** | 14.0+ | iPad | Supported with responsive layout |

#### Hardware Recommendations

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **RAM** | 2 GB | 4 GB or more |
| **Storage** | 100 MB free | 500 MB free |
| **Screen Resolution** | 360x640 | 1080x1920 or higher |

### 16.2 Network Requirements

| Connection Type | Minimum Speed | Recommended | Notes |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| **4G/LTE** | 1 Mbps | 5 Mbps or more | Best for mobile use |
| **3G** | 256 Kbps | — | Functional but may experience delays |
| **Wi-Fi** | 1 Mbps | 5 Mbps or more | Recommended for bidding |
| **5G** | — | Any | Excellent performance |
| **2G / Edge** | — | ❌ | Not supported; real-time updates will fail |

**Network Considerations:**
- **WebSocket connectivity** is required for real-time bid updates. Ensure your network/firewall does not block WebSocket connections (ports 80/443).
- **Latency**: For time-sensitive bidding, a connection with less than 500ms latency is recommended.
- **Offline behavior**: If you lose connection mid-bid, the bid may not be submitted. Reconnect and check "My Bids" to verify. Do not resubmit without checking, as this may result in a duplicate bid fee charge.
- **VPN**: Most VPNs are compatible. If real-time updates fail, try disabling the VPN or switching servers.

> **Warning**: Bidding over an unstable connection may result in failed submissions or delayed confirmations. Always verify your bid status in "My Bids" after placing a bid on an unstable connection.

## 17. FAQ

### General

**Q: What is the Lowest Unique Bid (LUB) auction?**
A: In a LUB auction, the winner is the person who placed the lowest bid amount that no one else placed. For example, if bids are 5.00, 10.00, 10.00, 15.00, the winner is the person who bid 5.00 (lowest and unique).

**Q: How much does it cost to bid?**
A: Each bid requires a non-refundable bid service fee (starting from 1.00 ETB, configurable per auction). The fee is deducted from your wallet when you place the bid.

**Q: Can I get a refund if I don't win?**
A: No, the bid service fee is non-refundable. However, if you win and pay, but the auction is cancelled by admin, you will receive a refund.

**Q: How many bids can I place?**
A: Maximum 150 bids per auction per user.

**Q: How long do I have to pay if I win?**
A: 24 hours from the auction closure time. If you don't pay, the auction will be offered to the next winner (second lowest unique bid, etc.).

**Q: Why do auctions get extended?**
A: Auctions are extended by 24 hours if: (1) the minimum bid threshold is not met, or (2) no unique bids exist. This ensures fair play for all participants.

**Q: What happens if I win but don't pay?**
A: Your payment will expire after 24 hours. The auction will be offered to the next winner (second lowest unique bid). Your payment status will be marked as EXPIRED.

### Terms & Conditions

**Q: Why do I need to accept Terms & Conditions?**
A: The Terms & Conditions define the rules of participation, your rights, and your responsibilities. You must accept them before placing bids or making deposits to ensure you understand and agree to the platform's operating terms.

**Q: What happens if I decline the Terms & Conditions?**
A: You cannot participate in any auction activity (bidding, deposits, payments) without accepting. If you decline an update, you will be logged out and cannot participate until you accept.

**Q: How will I know if the Terms & Conditions change?**
A: You will see a notification upon next login or app open. A summary of changes is provided, and you must accept the updated terms before continuing.

**Q: What version of the Terms did I accept?**
A: Your Profile page shows your current T&C acceptance status, including the version and date accepted. This is also included in your data export.

### Product Approval

**Q: How do I know a product is legitimate?**
A: All products pass through a Product Approval Process before being assigned to auctions. An approver reviews the product name, description, images, market price, and specifications for accuracy and quality.

**Q: Can I see the approval status of a product?**
A: Administrators can see approval status in Admin → Products. Users see only approved products in auctions; pending or rejected products are never listed.

**Q: What if a product I won doesn't match its description?**
A: You can file a dispute under the "Product Issue" category (see [Section 8](#8-dispute-resolution)). If verified, you may receive a refund of your winner payment.

### SMS Reminders

**Q: How do I stop receiving SMS notifications?**
A: Go to Profile → Notifications → SMS Preferences and toggle off specific event types, or disable all SMS. Note that critical payment reminders may still be sent as required.

**Q: I'm not receiving SMS notifications. What should I do?**
A: Verify your phone number is correct in your profile. Check that SMS preferences are enabled for the event type. Ensure your mobile carrier is not blocking short-code messages. Contact support if issues persist.

**Q: Will I get a reminder before my winner payment expires?**
A: Yes. You receive reminders at 6 hours, 18 hours, and 23 hours after auction closure, plus a final expiration notice at 24 hours. The final reminder is always sent regardless of your notification preferences.

### Settlement

**Q: What is a settlement?**
A: A settlement is the financial reconciliation of a closed auction — it records the total bid fee revenue, winner payment, and platform revenue. Settlements are immutable once completed.

**Q: Can I see settlement data for an auction I participated in?**
A: Yes. After an auction closes, go to the Winner Screen and tap "Settlement Details" to see the auction's financial summary.

**Q: Why does the platform keep bid fees?**
A: Bid fees are the service charge for participating in the auction. They are the platform's primary revenue source and are clearly disclosed before each bid.

### Account

**Q: How do I change my password?**
A: Currently, password changes require contacting support. This feature will be available in a future update.

**Q: How do I reset my wallet PIN?**
A: If you forget your PIN, contact support for a reset. After 5 failed attempts, your PIN will be locked for 30 minutes automatically.

**Q: Can I have multiple accounts?**
A: Each account must use a unique phone number. Creating multiple accounts with the same phone number is not allowed.

**Q: How do I delete my account?**
A: Go to Profile → Data Settings → Delete Account. Account deletion is irreversible and will remove all your data. See [Section 11.3](#113-right-to-erasure) for details on what is retained.

### Payments

**Q: Which payment methods are supported?**
A: Currently, Awash Bank Mobile Wallet and SikinaPay are supported. Internal wallet top-up is also available.

**Q: Is it safe to use my card on SikinaPay?**
A: Yes, SikinaPay uses industry-standard encryption and security measures. Your card details are never stored on TakeLow servers.

**Q: What happens if my payment fails?**
A: If a payment fails, no funds are deducted from your account. You can retry with the same or a different payment method.

**Q: Why was my payment marked as FAILED?**
A: Common reasons: insufficient balance, card declined by bank, network timeout. Try again or contact your bank.

### Technical

**Q: Why can't I see real-time updates?**
A: Ensure you have a stable internet connection. Real-time updates require WebSocket connectivity. Check if your browser or firewall blocks WebSocket connections.

**Q: Why am I getting "Session Expired"?**
A: Your session has timed out due to 30 minutes of inactivity or 12-hour absolute timeout. Simply log in again.

**Q: The app is slow. What can I do?**
A: Try clearing your browser cache (web) or restarting the app (mobile). Ensure you have a stable internet connection.

**Q: Why does my bid sometimes take time to appear?**
A: Bids are batch-persisted for performance. There may be a slight delay (a few seconds) before your bid appears in the bid list.

**Q: What happens if the auction engine restarts during a live auction?**
A: The system uses Redis for real-time state. When auction-engine restarts, it reconnects to Redis and continues broadcasting. You may see a brief pause (a few seconds) in updates, but no data is lost.

**Q: How does the system ensure fair play during high traffic?**
A: The system uses Redis distributed locks and nonce validation to prevent race conditions. Each bid is processed sequentially per auction, ensuring fairness even under heavy load.

### Security & Compliance

**Q: What data does TakeLow log for audit purposes?**
A: TakeLow logs all admin actions (user management, auction operations), bidding events, payment transactions, and data access events. Logs include actor ID, action, entity, timestamp, and structured details. Logs are immutable and retained indefinitely for compliance.

**Q: Can I request my data audit trail?**
A: Yes, you can export your account data including bid history and transactions from Profile → Data Settings. Admin users can access full audit logs via Admin → Audit Logs.

**Q: How is my payment data protected?**
A: Payment data is encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM. Webhook signatures are verified with HMAC-SHA256. Card details are never stored on TakeLow servers — they are processed entirely by SikinaPay/Awash Bank.

**Q: What happens to my data if I delete my account?**
A: Account deletion removes your personal data (profile, bids, favorites, notifications). Audit logs and payment records are retained for compliance (7 years for payments, indefinite for audit). Anonymized bid data may remain for auction transparency.

### Accessibility & Language

**Q: Does TakeLow support screen readers?**
A: Yes. The web platform supports NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver. The mobile apps support TalkBack (Android) and VoiceOver (iOS). See [Section 14](#14-accessibility) for details.

**Q: Can I use TakeLow with keyboard only?**
A: Yes. All web functionality is accessible via keyboard. See [Section 14.2](#142-keyboard-navigation) for keyboard navigation details.

**Q: What languages are supported?**
A: English, Amharic, Oromo (Afaan Oromoo), and Tigrinya. See [Section 15](#15-multi-language-support) for details.
